# WeatherApp

This is my weatherApp written in React.js. As you probably guessed, this app is created for monitoring the weather in your location.  I used  **React-Bootstrap** to create layout. Additionally, it has been styled with **styled-components**. Weather data is provided by *OpenWeather* and fetched using **Axios**. Moreover, I used **Chart.js** to create *bar chart* and *line chart* to better present my data. 

## Still in progress:
