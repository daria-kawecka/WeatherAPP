# WeatherApp ☀️🌩❄️

This is my weatherApp written in React.js. As you probably guessed, this app is created for monitoring the weather in your location. I used **React-Bootstrap** to create layout. Additionally, it has been styled with **styled-components**. Weather data is provided by _OpenWeather_ and fetched using **Axios**. Moreover, I used **Chart.js** to create _bar chart_ and _line chart_ to better present my data.
